# Portfolio Repository: Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing Projects

Welcome to my portfolio repository, showcasing a comprehensive collection of projects centered around Machine Learning (ML), Large Language Models (LLMs), Langchain, and Vector Databases. This repository serves as a testament to my skills, knowledge, and hands-on experience in natural language processing and machine learning, accumulated through the completion of the Langchain and Vector Database certification by Activeloop.

## Overview

The projects in this repository are a culmination of my learnings and applications in ML, LLMs, Langchain, and Vector Databases. They demonstrate my capability to not only implement and optimize existing models and technologies but also to innovate and create solutions tailored to specific problems.

## Projects Details

- **Projects 1-9:** These projects are based on notebooks provided as part of the Activeloop certification program, showcasing my ability to work with and understand the intricacies of various ML and NLP technologies and methodologies.

- **Projects 10-13:** Derived from public repositories associated with the Activeloop certification program, these projects represent more advanced applications and understandings. The original repositories are publicly accessible, and my inclusion of these projects here serves to highlight my ability to comprehend, utilize, and potentially replicate similar projects independently.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Demonstrating extensive work and understanding of various LLMs, highlighting their capabilities and applications.
- **Langchain:** Showcasing projects and applications developed using Langchain, emphasizing my proficiency in this area.
- **Vector Databases:** Employing vector databases to enhance the functionality and efficiency of applications, illustrating my skills in working with these databases.

## Repository Navigation

Each project is housed in its own folder, complete with all necessary code, documentation, and resources. For Projects 10-13, please note that these were sourced from public repositories as part of a certification program, and my work on these projects demonstrates my capability to understand, adapt, and potentially recreate similar work independently.
