# Portfolio Repository: Machine Learning, NLP, and Web Development Projects

Welcome to my comprehensive portfolio repository, where I showcase a wide array of projects that demonstrate my expertise in Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Langchain, and Web Development. This collection of projects reflects my diverse skill set and my ability to apply advanced technologies to solve real-world problems.

## Overview

This repository is structured into two main categories:

1. **Langchain + LLMs:** This folder contains projects that highlight my proficiency in leveraging Large Language Models and Langchain to build innovative applications, ranging from chatbots and article summarizers to autonomous agents. 

2. **Web Development:** This folder showcases my full-stack web development skills, featuring projects that demonstrate my ability to create seamless, user-friendly web applications from front to back.

## Langchain + LLMs

The projects within this category demonstrate my deep understanding and practical knowledge of state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques and large language models. They highlight my ability to create intelligent and interactive applications that can understand, generate, and interact with human language in a meaningful way.

## Web Development

The projects in this category showcase my versatility as a full-stack developer, highlighting my proficiency in both front-end and back-end technologies. From creating responsive user interfaces to implementing robust server-side logic, these projects demonstrate my comprehensive skill set in web development.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Large Language Models (LLMs) and Langchain:** For building intelligent and interactive NLP applications.
- **Full-Stack Web Development:** Utilizing various modern frameworks and libraries for both front-end and back-end development.

## Getting Started
